<HTML><BODY>Edward Edson Lee (September 2, 1884 in Meriden, Illinois – September 28, 1944 in Rockford, Illinois), who wrote under the pen name of Leo Edwards, was a popular children's literature author in the 1920s and 1930s.

<p>He wrote five series of books: the <i>Jerry Todd</i> series of sixteen books; the <i>Poppy Ott</i> series of eleven books; the <i>Trigger Berg</i> series of four books; the <i>Andy Blake</i> series of four books; and the <i>Tuffy Bean</i> series of four books. All of the series were interrelated in some way; the Todd and Ott stories took place in the town of Tutter, Illinois, a fictional town modeled on the town of Utica, which Lee experienced in his childhood. The supporting characters in the Todd and Ott books — "Red" Meyers, "Scoop" Ellery, and "Peg" Shaw — were real boys that Lee befriended around the time he began writing the stories while living in Shelby, Ohio.

</p><p>Since his books have been out-of-copyright outside the US for many years, several of his books are already available with our friends at <a href="https://www.fadedpage.com/csearch.php?author=Lee%2C%20Edward%20Edson">FadedPage</a>, so I will concentrate here first on the books not yet available there.

</p><p>More titles like this will become public domain in the coming years, so we will be able to have lots of fun with them for the foreseeable future.
